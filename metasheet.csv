# The first column(run) is the run name that you could define. For RNA-seq, a run(or batch) of RNA-seq samples should share same name though they could be 
# devided into several rows for different fastq files. For microarray data, you only need set one row for a batch of data.
#
# The second column(sample) should always be samples, this should be some kinds of sample ID. This sample ID *must* match the sample names in the config yaml file
# 
# The third column(experment_type) defined the experiment type of data {RS, MA_A, MA_O, MA_I}
# RS for RNA-seq, MA_{} for microarry data generated by *A*ffymatrix, *O*ligo or *I*llumina.
# 
# The fourth(condition) and fifth colunms(treatment): for RNA-seq, you could write some comments for data. For microarray samples, you are supposed to specify a path of file that include
# sample information at fourth column and a path for GPL file at fifth column. The files format is addressed at README.md.
# 
# The sixth column(replicates): ONLY FOR RNA-seq sample: mark repelicate for RNA-seq samples.
#
# The seventh column(compare_XXX):
# The samples that you want to perform a Differential Expression on using limma and deseq should be marked by the “compare_” columns more on this below
# The “control” should be marked with a 1, and the “treatment” should be marked with a 2.
# You are allowed to have as many “compare_XXXX” columns as you want at the end.
