# The first column should always be sample, this should be some kind of sample ID. This sample ID must match the sample names in the config file
#
# The samples that you want to perform a Differential Expression (DE) on using limma and deseq should be marked by the “comp” columns more on this below
# The “control” should be marked with a 1, and the “treatment” should be marked with a 2.
#
# Sample must always be first, and you are allowed to have as many “compare_XXXX” columns as you want at the end.
